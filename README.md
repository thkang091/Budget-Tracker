# Budget-Tracker
A solo full-stack web application built with React, Tailwind CSS, Firebase, and Google Cloud Platform. It features a Financial Overview, Budgets, saving goals, and a user-centric profile with extensive statistics and export to PDF/Excel. Supports multiple currencies, ensuring regional flexibility, and emphasizes user privacy. 

## Deployed Website

The budget tracker web application is live and can be accessed at:

[https://budgettracking-73e00.web.app/dashboard](https://budgettracking-73e00.web.app/dashboard)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.\
The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
Refer to the [testing documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.\
The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed.

See the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you need to customize the build tool and configuration, you can `eject`. This command will copy all configuration files and dependencies into your project, giving you full control over them. All commands except `eject` will continue to work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them as needed.
